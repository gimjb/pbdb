# Privacy Policy for PBDB

This privacy policy governs the manner in which PBDB collects, uses, and
maintains information collected from users of the Discord bot.

## Information Collection and Use

PBDB collects, stores, and processes the following information:

- user preferences (`/settings`) for displaying Bible verses:
  - the user’s Discord ID;
  - whether to post as a Discord embed or blockquote;
  - whether to post verses inline or on separate lines; and
  - whether to use "straight" or "curly” quotes (also known as "smart" quotes);
- the cooldown period for posting the same verse in the same version in the same
  channel (default: 3 minutes):
  - the server’s Discord ID;
  - the channel’s Discord ID; and
  - the verse’s reference (e.g., `John 3:16`).

## Information Sharing

The information collected by PBDB is not shared with any third parties. It is
used exclusively by the bot to deliver personalized verse displays and to
prevent spamming of verses or changing or removing the cooldown period.

## Data Security

PBDB takes reasonable measures to protect the information collected from users.
The collected information is stored in a secure MongoDB database. Only the bot
and the bot owner have access to this database.

## User Rights

Users have the right to request the removal of their data from the database. To
exercise this right, users can contact the bot owner through Discord
(@090302_5409). Upon receiving such a request, the bot owner will promptly
remove the user's data from the database.

## Updates to the Privacy Policy

PBDB reserves the right to update this privacy policy at any time. Users are
encouraged to periodically review this policy to stay informed about how their
information is being collected, used, and protected.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the practices
of PBDB, you can contact the bot owner via Discord (@090302_5409) or via email
(<090302@5409.dk>).
