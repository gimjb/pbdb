title: Irresistible Grace
---
The elect cannot resist the grace of God and will be saved (John 6:37, 44; 10:27–29; Romans 8:29–30; Philippians 1:6). This doctrine is the “I” in the acronym TULIP and is different from the Calvinist understanding of Irresistible Grace (which should be called “Irresistible Gospel”) in that Primitive Baptists believe that the elect will be saved regardless of whether they hear or believe the gospel (cf. Romans 10:14–15 and Revelation 7:9–10).
