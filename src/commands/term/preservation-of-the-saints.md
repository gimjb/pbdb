title: Preservation of the Saints
---
Those who are saved will never lose their salvation (John 10:27–29; Romans 8:29–30; Philippians 1:6), even if they fall into sin or unbelief. This doctrine is the “P” in the acronym TULIP and is not to be confused with the Calvinist “*Perseverance* of the Saints.”
