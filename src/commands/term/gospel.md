Referred as “good tidings” meaning “good news” (Romans 10:15). The gospel is the good news of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ which saved His people from their sins (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). The gospel is not the means to get eternal salvation, but rather is the good news about how Jesus gave His people eternal salvation (2 Timothy 1:10).
