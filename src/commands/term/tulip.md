title: TULIP
---
TULIP in Primitive Baptist theology is an abbreviation for the following:
- **Total Depravity**: all are born in sin and are unable to do anything to save themselves.
- **Unconditional Election**: God has chosen to save some people and not others, and this choice is not based on anything that the person has done or will do.
- **Limited Atonement**: Jesus died only for the elect, and not for all people.
- **Irresistible Grace**: the elect cannot resist the grace of God and will be saved, even if they will never hear or believe the gospel.
- **Preservation of the Saints**: those who are saved will never lose their salvation, even if they fall into sin or unbelief.
