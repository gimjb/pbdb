title: Eternal Salvation
---
When God saves one of the elect from his sins by Christ dying for his sins and gives him eternal life through regeneration (Hebrews 9:12; Hebrews 9:15). Eternal salvation is not dependent on anything that the elect do, including their faith or other works, but only on the sovereign grace of God (2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 3:5).
