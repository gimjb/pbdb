title: Justification
---
Simply means to “declare righteous.” The Scriptures speak of this declaration taking place in at least three ways:
1. **Justification by the Blood and Righteousness of Jesus Christ:** Through Jesus Christ’s sacrifice, God sees his elect as righteous, not counting their sins against them (Romans 4:6–8; Romans 5:8–10; 2 Corinthians 5:19–21; Hebrews 1:3; 9:26; 10:14–18). This means they can not be condemned because Jesus died and rose again for them, making them right with God. This takes place without depending on the person’s actions (Romans 4:25; Romans 8:31–34).
2. **Justification by the Means of Faith:** Through faith, when a person believes in God and the truth of the Gospel, they are seen as righteous. This faith brings peace with God and assurance of being righteous because of Christ. This is about being declared righteous to oneself, in one’s own conscience.
3. **Justification Which Takes Place by Works:** Through actions, which prove one’s faith to others. This does not affect one’s standing before God but shows others that the person’s faith is genuine. James explains that faith without actions is dead, so true faith is shown by how one acts towards others.
