title: Unconditional Election

God has chosen to save some people and not others (Ephesians 1:4–7), and this choice is not based on anything that the person has done or will do (Romans 9:11–13), neither water baptism nor faith nor anything else has influenced God’s choice. This doctrine is the “U” in the acronym TULIP.
