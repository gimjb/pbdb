title: Conversion
---
The process that a child of God goes through when he hears the gospel, repents of his sins, is baptized, and turns the direction of his life from living in sin to keeping God’s commandments (Luke 22:32; Matthew 16:16-17; James 5:19–20). Conversion can only happen after a person has been regenerated.
